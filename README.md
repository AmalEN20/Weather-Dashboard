# Weather-Dashboard
- I have created a weather control panel that runs in the browser and contains dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- I used 5 days weather forecast links to an external site to get weather data for cities.

# User Story

- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.
